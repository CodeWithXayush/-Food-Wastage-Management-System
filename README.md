## 🍽️ Local Food Wastage Management System

📖 Overview

The Local Food Wastage Management System (LFWMS) is a comprehensive platform designed to tackle food waste through efficient management of donation and redistribution networks. It connects providers (restaurants, supermarkets, cafeterias) with receivers (NGOs, shelters, food banks), leveraging data analytics, stakeholder management, and interactive dashboards.

🚀 Features
•	Real-time Food Tracking – Monitor surplus food with expiry dates & quantities.
•	Stakeholder Management – Maintain provider & receiver databases.
•	Claims Monitoring – Track redistribution success rates.
•	Waste Analysis – Identify bottlenecks & high-risk categories.
•	Data Insights – Actionable reports for policy & resource allocation.
•	Interactive Dashboard – Streamlit-powered UI with charts & KPIs.
⚙️ System Architecture
The system consists of data sources (CSV), a data pipeline using Pandas/SQL, a SQLite database, analytics/visualization modules (Matplotlib/Seaborn), and an interactive dashboard (Streamlit).

📂 Dataset Structure
•	Providers.csv – Surplus food donors.
•	Receivers.csv – NGOs/organizations receiving food.
•	Food Listings.csv – Food items with expiry, category, provider details.
•	Claims.csv – Food redistribution transactions.

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
•	Food Recovery Rate = (Claimed / Listed) × 100
•	Provider Retention Rate = Active donors over time
•	Waste Reduction Index = (Collected / Total Listed) × 100
•	Response Latency = Avg. time from listing to claim
•	Collection Success Ratio = (Collected / Claimed) × 100
